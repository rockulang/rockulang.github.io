## This post is from former WordPress blog


I have been thinking a lot about making a blog but I cannot deny I have procrastinated as much as I have thought.

My first trial was in 2015. I tried making a personal blog offered by Naver, the biggest portal in Korea, but as you might have guessed, it didn’t last long. I blamed myself for not being a regular writer, but to be honest, I didn’t have much to write. But applause for the trial. I think I wanted to write about my life in the UK in 2012-13, but to be honest, it was quite hard to recall old, blurry memories without having many pictures and video recordings.

After my first failure, I have repeated thinking and putting it off whenever it came up to my mind. During the last couple of years, I’ve sort of exposed myself to the world of writing, practised by writing journals, etc. Also, finally, I have decided what to write. Finally..! 
I would call this past period… “a time of ripeness.” (WTF? A ripeness?)

If you make a blog with WordPress, there is an example post in which it says like this:

“You’re going to publish a post today. Don’t worry about how your blog looks. Don’t worry if you haven’t given it a name yet, or you’re feeling overwhelmed. Just click the “New Post” button, and tell us why you’re here.“

Yes, I agree with you, WordPress. You can’t have a perfect blog from the very beginning. It’s impossible and I have dreamt the impossible all the time, even before the beginning, even in my brain. Just do it. Who cares? Just write what you want to write. And that’s it.

It would be great if this blog was full of information, knowledge, and wisdom. But, alas, God has already brought them into one single book. Read the Bible, it will feed you all of them.

I’m not sure if I can post it on a regular basis nor the contents will be written in English. (English is not my first language, so there can be a lot of grammatical errors.) But I should promise to myself. This is gonna be my last blog in my life.
